## Py-automapper

The idea came from a need on the project to map types of "different nature" between each other. Namely, if we take TortoiseORM Model class and Python dataclass there's no, known to me, single method to retrieve list of fields required by the class. Current autommapper allows to create mappings between these two classes and allows to write extensions for supporting other classes as well.

For now check out [README.md](https://github.com/anikolaienko/py-automapper) file in the repository for more information
